# appNote
* appNote is an application where you'll can type notes and save them with title.
* It's currently un-working, because I'm still an IT student so I need a little bit more time.
* It was codded first in full C++ but I realized C++ was too old to provide a good and easy graphic interface so now there's a little bit of python. 

# How it works 

- C++ 
    - Files with functions
    - (.h files)
    - Files to load and convert C++ data into Python 
- Python 
    - graphic interface 

# State 
* For now on, I've codded few functions in C++, and basically all you need for this type of app (create note, view note, search a specific note ...)
* I'm trying now to load C++ data into Python
