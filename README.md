# appNote
* appNote is an application where you'll can type notes and save them with title.
* It's currently un-working, because I'm still an IT student so I need a little bit more time.
* It was codded first in full C++ but I realized C++ was too old to provide a good and easy graphic interface so now there's a little bit of python. Edit : Now everything is in python ahah

# How it works 

- Python 
    - Files with functions
    - Window file (w/ Tkinter)
    - Classes  

# State 
* For now on, I've codded few functions in python, and I'm trying to developp all the underlying function to make this work
